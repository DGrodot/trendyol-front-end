<h3 align="left"> About Case </h3>

You are working in a technology department with 1200 people. The Tech department has 120 scrum teams. Since teams work remotely, nobody knows each 
other.

You have a great idea to solve communication problems. You will create an online sticker album so that teams can get familiar with each other.

<h3 align="left"> Acceptance Criteria </h3>

- Each team in the department should have its own section
- A person can open only 3 sticker sets in a day
- Each sticker set has 6 stickers
- Clean code and readable folder structure
- You can use any tech stack which you feel comfortable
- You do not need a backend code, you can use Json File or in memory database to manage teams and team members
